        = RooL is a stupid wad created by Ozymandias81 on August 7 2016

This jokewad aims to roll all stuff seen on screen for Doom 2 in a no-sense way.
             It's just experimenting with new features from GZDoom.

  Expect some weird things with monsters because they can't aim you properly.

================================================================================

  You'll need the most recent build of GZDoom to run properly this crazyness.
          Download it from here: http://devbuilds.drdteam.org/gzdoom/

================================================================================

  Decorate replacements & "tweaks" written by Ozymandias81 M_DOOM graphic done
   with GIMP & then crushed via Slade by Ozymandias81 Shaders by MaxED, fract
                           suggestions from Graf Zahl

  You can do whatever you want with both "code" and "graphics" provided within
    this wad as far as you credit properly the ones who did these resources.

                       Have some nice headaches with it.
