RooL is a stupid wad created by Ozymandias81 on August 7 2016

You'll need the most recent build of GZDoom to run properly this crazyness.

Decorate replacements & "tweaks" written by Ozymandias81

This jokewad aims to roll all enemies from Doom 2 in a no-sense way.
It's just experimenting with new features from GZDoom.
Expect some weird things with monsters because they can't aim you properly.
I also decided to not replace in any case BossCube related actors and Commander Keen ones.

You can do whatever you want with both "code" and "graphics" provided within this wad.

Have some nice haedaches with it.
